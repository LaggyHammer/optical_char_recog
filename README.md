# Information Extraction from Engineering Drawings using OCR

This project is for developing a script for optical character recognition from Screen GA diagrams to automatically fill detailed tables.

## Background
General Arrangement drawings of Vibrating screens contain important information such as loads, spring details, size, motor details, mass etc. This information needs to be compiled in a single file for all screen variants for quick reference and maintain a central database for screen details. Creating such database is a tedious task which involves repeating Copy-Paste process or manually typing the information in case of Scanned drawings for each screen variant. Automating this task of extracting text from GA drawings using optical character recognition packages like Tesseract OCR will reduce the human effort drastically and help to avoid mistakes.

## System Requirements
* Windows 10 64-bit
* Tesseract OCR engine (provided with package)
* Poppler Utility (provided with package)
